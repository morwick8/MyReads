# MyReads Project

This is Michelle Orwick's MyReads Project as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Develpment Nanodegree.

It allows the user to keep track of books that you're currently reading, want to read, and have read by clicking on the menu attached to each book.

It also allows the user to search on key terms through a database of books and place them in their MyReads page as currently reading, want to read, and have read.

This project is based on starter code provided by Udacity, Inc. and I have drawn from code examples from the lessons in the React unit that was part of the FEND nanodegree program in 2018. I'd like to thank schizo-99 and jayjongcheolpark for inspiration on solving some of the tricky problems of setting up routes to the search page, linking to 3rd party images, and techniques for searching with the constraints on search provided.

I'm submitting this through the MyReads Project Workspace, so there should not be any special loading instructions.  

I'd like to thank the reviewers in advance for their feedback, as I know the project is not fully bug free.  Further guidance is desperately needed.
